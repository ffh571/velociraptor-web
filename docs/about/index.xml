      <description>Velociraptor vs GRR/ Velociraptor vs OSQuery Velociraptor draws inspiration from two major projects:
 GRR https://github.com/google/grr OSQuery https://github.com/osquery/osquery  Velociraptor is actively being used by DFIR professionals across cases such as these and continues to grow and develop based on their feedback and ideas.

Deployment overview Typical deployments Velociraptor is very efficient and scalable:
Server simply collects the results of queries - clients do all the heavy lifting.
 Client memory and CPU usage is controlled via throttling and active cancellations.  Server is optimized for speed and scalability
 Concurrency control ensures stability Bandwidth limits ensure network stability  Current recommendations for typical deployments:  10k-15k clients - single server with file based data store (usually cloud VM).</description>

      <description>To give you a taste of what Velociraptor can do, here are some of the more interesting features:
Easy setup and deployment  Velociraptor ships as a singe executable which has no dependencies and requires no installation routine Settings are defined by a pair of config files - one for the server and one for each endpoint All comms between endpoints and the server are encrypted The GUI supports SSL and SSO via Google Auth for strong identity management Once an endpoint is started, it&amp;rsquo;s instantly available on the server dashboard (after a browser refresh).</description>
