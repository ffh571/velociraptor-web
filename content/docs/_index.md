Welcome to Velociraptor's documentation.

If you're new to Velociraptor, you should start by reading the
[Getting Started](./getting-started) guide, which guides you through setup and running your first
hunts.



The [User Interface](./user-interface) guide is also worth reviewing.

<!--
For some ideas on how Velociraptor can help you, visit the [Use Cases](./use_cases) section.
-->

When you're ready to see what Velociraptor can really do for you:

* Run some artifacts across individual endpoints
* Build them out into hunts
* Start customizing the artifacts to your specific needs.

You'll be surprised how powerful and easy it can be.

**Just want the latest version?** Sure, it's freely available on our
  [Github releases](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/releases) page.
